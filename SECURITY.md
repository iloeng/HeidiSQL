## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability, please file a ticket here. You may also send an
email to security@heidisql.com .

It is important that the report is _valid_, and I am able to _understand_ the vulnerability impact.
If so, you may expect an update within weeks, probably quicker. I'll do my best to keep the
software and the user systems intact.
